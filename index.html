                Welcome to My Software Development: <br>
                This website is a showcase of my completed projects and skills acquired during my time at Templemore College of Further Education.  <br>
                I built this website using HTML and CSS, the basics of web development. However, creating a functional and attractive website involves <br>
                more than just coding. It requires a deep understanding of the underlying principles and concepts of software development.</h4> <br>
            <h4 class="texting">  Key Subjects: <br>
                The modules I completed for this webpage project include Mobile Technologies, Software Architecture, and Work Experience. These subjects <br>
                are essential to the course and have helped me gain a deeper understanding of software development. Mobile Technologies taught me how to <br>
                design and develop mobile applications that are user-friendly and efficient. Software Architecture showed me how to design and implement <br>
                software systems that are scalable, maintainable, and efficient. Work Experience gave me the opportunity to apply the skills I learned in <br>
                the course to real-world projects and scenarios.</h4><br>
            <h4 class="texting">Tools: <br>
                The Tools page on this website features a BMI calculator, which I built as part of the course. This tool demonstrates my ability to apply the <br>
                skills I learned in the course to create practical and useful applications. The BMI calculator is a simple yet effective tool that calculates <br>
                an individual's body mass index based on their height and weight. It's a great example of how software development can be used to create solutions <br>
                that make a positive impact on people's lives.</h4>  <br>
            <h4 class="texting">  Why Templemore College? <br>
                Choosing to study Software Development at Templemore College was a great decision. The college provides a supportive environment for all students, <br>
                and the principal is always available to help whenever needed. The college's commitment to health and safety is evident in its well-maintained facilities, <br>
                creating an ideal environment for both study and personal growth. The college's focus on practical skills and real-world applications has given me <br>
                the confidence and skills to pursue a career in software development.</h4>  <br>
             <h4 class="texting">  My Experience: <br>
                Throughout my time at Templemore College, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects and assignments that have helped me develop my <br>
                skills and knowledge in software development. From building simple web applications to designing and implementing complex software systems, I have gained <br>
                a deep understanding of the principles and concepts of software development. I have also worked with various programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript.</h4> <br>
            <h4 class="texting">    What I have Learned: <br>
                One of the most important things I have learned during my time at Templemore College is the importance of problem solving and critical thinking. Software development <br>
                is not just about writing code, it is about solving real world problems and creating solutions that make a positive impact on people's lives. I have also learned the <br>
                importance of collaboration and teamwork. Software development is often a team effort, and being able to work effectively with others is essential to success.</h4> <br>
            <h4 class="texting">   Conclusion: <br>
                In conclusion, this website is a showcase of my completed projects and skills acquired during my time at Templemore College of Further Education. <br>
                The key subjects and tools featured on the website demonstrate my ability to apply the skills I learned in the course to create practical and useful <br>
                applications. Choosing to study Software Development at Templemore College has been a great decision, and I am grateful for the supportive environment and <br> 
                commitment to health and safety. I am confident that the skills and knowledge I have gained will serve me well in my future career as a software developer.</h4>  <br>
